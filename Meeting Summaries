Saturday - Oct 3rd
 Group role assignments:   
     Repo Master : Clean repo and make sure things are structured nice-> Missy
     Build Master / Architect : Overall build plan and design-> Lindsay
     Documentation Boss / Schedule : Make sure everything is on track and document meetings and project-> Donna
     Quality Assurance : Test code and modules to make sure all is running smoothly -> Xuehai

 Project Overview / Sketch out MVP:
  we divided the MVP into 3 "chunks" and assigned it to each person:
    1. Parse_gpx (pathname to gpx file) -> pandas dataframe
        * opens gpx file, pulls out lat, long, and time from each trkpt, and stores it in a data structure
        * python xml parser, gpxpy?, Beautiful Soup are all potentially helpful tools
        * Assignment: Donna
        * We'll try to use pandas since it can create an efficient dataframe and we can use pandas function to process the data
        * Donna will be the "pandas shifu" as she has had previous exprecience with pandas
            ** I thought the Kong Fu Panda reference was hilarious! :)
            
    2. Filtered_data (pandas dataframe) -> pandas dataframe with only data points immediately before and after each turn, and with street names added
        * uses a clever algorithm to get rid of unneeded data points (Binary search, Granular Search, etc.)
            ** could be approach 1 or 2 from the assignment document
                *** every data point that has the same street as the one before and after it â†’ you can eliminate it!*
            ** or could be something different, e.g. sample every 30 seconds
        * GOAL -> eliminate unnecessary points + add street names!!
        * Assignment : Xuehai
        
    3. Generate_directions (filtered pandas dataframe) -> csv file
        * generates turn-by-turn directions as a text file
            ** calculates distance between each turn (UTM)
            ** determines if it's a left or right turn (or straight ahead, but the street name changed
            ** writes this information to a csv file
        * Assignment : Missy & Lindsay
        * This will be the most challenging part of the project so we assigned two people to it. 
        
  Rough Timeline: 
    Donna will make a rough schedule by Monday and we'll revise or approve it on Monday.
    
  Other Notes:
    * Donna will also make a fake-sample dataframe and send it to everyone by Monday so everyone can start their work.
    * Until monday: each person will research their work as they're waiting for Donna to send the dataframe.
