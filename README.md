Welcome! Thank you for using our services!    
This program will take your gpx file and give you a table with turn by turn directions.

### How to use it:
#### 1. Choose an API.   
* Unfortunately, in order for our program to access the necessary geographic data, we need to provide a code called an API. You can get a free API a couple of ways, either way is a one-time process that will take about five minutes. Read on for detailed instructions with clear screenshots of each process.
* In this program you can choose between the Google API and Texam A&M GeoServices (TAMU) API. 
* Hints: 
    - Google API is faster and great for large data file, at the expense of accuracy.   
        - It will take roughly 2 and a half minutes to run a GPX file with 10,000 data points
        - Google API key is able to take care of a relatively larger amount of data points
        - You will need to enter a credit card number as part of the process for getting a Google API. According to Google you won't be charged; they do this to make sure you're a real person, not a robot.
    - TAMU API is limited to 5000 points, but is more accurate. So, it is much better for smaller files.
        - It will take about 7 to 8 minutes to run a GPX file with 10,000 data points
        - TAMUâ€™s address look up is more accurate, but it has fewer attempt times limits
        - In order to get a TAMU API, you'll need to sign up for a free account
    
#### 2. Get API key:
* **TAMU:**
    * Go to [TAMU Geoservice website](https://geoservices.tamu.edu/UserServices/Profile/Default.aspx) to register for a free account, then follow the steps shown in these figures
    * Click on **Services** on the top of the page

    * Click on **Reverse Geocoding** on the left side of the page
    <img width="652.5" height="332.5" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/2.png"> <br />
    * Scroll down a bit and you will see **Start Processing Data** under Reverse Geocoding APIs    
    <img width="652.5" height="453" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/3.png"> <br />
    * Click **REST** in this step   
    <img width="652.5" height="455" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/4.png"> <br />
    * Go to **click here for your API key**       
    <img width="652.5" height="454.5" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/5.png"> <br />
    * Then your API key will show on the page, copy it.

* **Google:**
    * Sign up for a Google account or log in if you already have one.
    * Go to [Google developer page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)
    * Click on **project selector page**       
    <img width="651" height="454.5" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/11.png"> <br />
    * In this page, click on **create project** to create a Google Cloud project     
    <img width="652.5" height="429.5" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/12.png"> <br />
    * Once you finish creating a project, you will see **APIs & Services > Credentials page**; click on that       
    <img width="652.5" height="429" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/13.png"> <br />
    * On the Credentials page, click Create credentials -> API key.     
    <img width="652.5" height="429" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/14.png"> <br />
    * The API key will show on your screen; copy it.      
    <img width="555" height="346" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/15.png"> <br />

    <img width="554.5" height="380.5" src="https://github.com/missystem/422gpx/blob/main/userImage/23.png"> <br />

* Once you copied your API key, return to our web page.
    - We recommend you save this code somewhere on your computer so that you can easily use our cuesheet generator over and over.
