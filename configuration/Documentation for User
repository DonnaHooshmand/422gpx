How to use it:
    1. Choose an API.
          In this program you can choose between the google API and TAMU API.
              Hint: Google API is faster and great for bigger files, at the expense of accuracy.
                    TAMU API is limited to 5000 points, but is more acruate. So, it is much better for smaller files.
    2. Get API key:
          * TAMU:
                a. Go to https://geoservices.tamu.edu/UserServices/Profile/Default.aspx
